    <h1>Adesh Grewal Engineering Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi everyone, I am Adesh an enthusiatic roboitcs engineer who loves 
        tinkering with technology and have always been intrigued by mechanisms and 
        the working of things wether it be a toy in my childhood or a decision making algorithm.
        Here I am Showcasing my robotics and engineering projects that i have done over the years</p>

      <img src="images/spot_robotic_arm.jpg" alt="Robotic Arm with Spot" />
      <div class="project-content">
        <h2 class="project-title">Assistive Robotics â€” Spot Integration</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          Developed a 3-DOF robotic arm integrated with Boston Dynamics Spot for Guide Dogs Australia. Focused on lightweight tendon-driven design, workspace optimization, and human-robot interaction testing. Conducted HIL testing for safety and reliability.

        <h2 class="project-title">UTS Motorsports Autonomous Race Car</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          Led the mechanical systems team to convert a race car for autonomous driving. Designed a dual-mode pedal box and Ackermann steering mechanism. Integrated with the full autonomous software stack to achieve sub-3s system latency.

        <p class="project-description">
          Programmed a Dobot Arm for image-guided pick-and-place using RGBD sensors, ArUco tags, and OpenCV visual servoing. Achieved accurate eye-to-hand calibration for real-time visual feedback.

        <h2 class="project-title"> fixed delta wing autonomous surveying plane </h2>
        <p class="project-description">
          Designed and built a fixed delta wing drone. It was done with a pixahawk PX4 which was Programmed
         to take starting position, gps coordinates of the area that was supposed to be surveyed and
         come up with the waypoints that were generated.
         the fixed wing had automatic aileron stabilazation and in flight control was completely autonomous </p>
